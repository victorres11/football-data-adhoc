## Muffed Punt

## Lost opportunities
Penn State had just scored to get up late in the first half and missed out on a great chance to getting another late score before end of half. PSU had a for sure TFL on second down with two timeouts left, but a facemask penalty let northwestern get off easy.

Not only that, northwestern stepped on the gas and almost scored another TD - but got the late field goal to go into halftime just down 1.

## Another muffed punt, this time PSU
Leads to a Northwestern Posession in Low Redzone which leads to another northwestern fieldgoal to gain the lead 16-14.

## Drew allar knocked out for season

## Grunkmeyer forced into action on 4th & 3 with 3 minutes left in game. Gets absolutely smoked by defense
