# Purdue vs Minnesota Manual Notes

## Purdue Scores Early TD with a package with backup QB, pays off early
In their first drive of the game, they surprisingly switched to their back up QB Malachi Singleton for an early 4th down attempt. It paid off big with not only a conversion but a long TD run (his first this year).

## Awesome play by Purdue WR to end 1st quarter
What looked like an interception by the Minnesota corner, ended up being wrestled away to prevent the turnover AND get the big gain by WR Nitro Tuggle.

## QB Scramble for TD
Pretty remarkable effort to contort body while going out of bounds to get the nose of the ball on the pylor for the Rush TD

## Early 4th Quarter - Bailed out by facemask
After Purdue drove and missed a FG, their defense had a 3rd and long opportunity against Minn. On a dropback the pressure got to Drake Lindsey, but #18 got called for a facemask on the sack - giving MINN a new set of downs. Minn would drive down the field (aided by a second facemask against qb by same player) and get the equalizing TD.

## MINN takes lead with a quick pick-six
On the first play after the Minnesota score to equalize, Purdue throws an intercpetion to Koi Perich who takes it back for a defensive score. Minn leads by 7.

In Purdue's reubttle drive after the pick six, they drive down the field and find themself on a 4th and goal. Minnesota runs a cover 0 blitz and tight coverage successfully defends the goal line pass play to WR #2 Michael Jackson III
