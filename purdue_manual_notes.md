# Purdue vs Minnesota Manual Notes

## Purdue Scores Early TD with a package with backup QB, pays off early
In their first drive of the game, they surprisingly switched to their back up QB Malachi Singleton for an early 4th down attempt. It paid off big with not only a conversion but a long TD run (his first this year).

## Awesome play by Purdue WR to end 1st quarter
What looked like an interception by the Minnesota corner, ended up being wrestled away to prevent the turnover AND get the big gain by WR Nitro Tuggle.

## QB Scramble for TD
Pretty remarkable effort to contort body while going out of bounds to get the nose of the ball on the pylor for the Rush TD
